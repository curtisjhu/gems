# Rendering a Minion from Scratch
> Based on the following [video from Inigo Quilez](https://youtu.be/8--5LwHRhjk). 

Normally in industry, you'd create a triangular mesh of the minion, which material properties or textures over the mesh. In our minion, we'll do this slightly different. We'll rely only on Ray Casting using only the shader.

	<img src="" alt="minion" />
	<caption>Final result</caption>

For the large part, a minion is [pill shaped](https://iquilezles.org/articles/distfunctions/).
