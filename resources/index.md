# Introduction

This repository consists of implementations of cool graphics concepts that I find interesting.

[]()

Some of the ideas are found in the [Nvidia GPU Book Gems series](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems/foreword), [Ray Tracing Gems](https://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracinggems/), or [PBRT](https://www.pbrt.org/). 

For a comprehensive list of Graphics resources, look at [realtimerendering.com](https://www.realtimerendering.com/books.html). That's enough reading for one lifetime.
